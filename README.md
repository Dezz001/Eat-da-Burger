# Eat-da-Burger

The purpose of this app is to type in the burger you would like and then place your order, via clicking the "Submit Order" button. Your order is displayed on the left side of the screen and when you are ready to eat it click the "Devour It!!!" button next to the burger. The eaten burger will then appear on the right side of the screen. Enter and eat as many burgers you would like.

The localhost port is set to 8080 and the server port is 8889. This app uses node.js, javascript, mysql, express, body-parser and handlebars.

Current Challenges and Notes:
1. Final product is not aesthetically pleasing.
2. Burger will not diplay properly in "Burgers Available to Eat" column when you submit your order.
3. Devoured burgers are not displayed in the "Burgers That Have Been Eaten" column, I believe it has something to do with my index.handlebars file coding.
4. I manually created and seeded the database from mysql instead of using the schema and seed files.

Thanks
